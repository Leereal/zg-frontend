let email = "leereal08@gmail.com"

//I want to take only 3 letter of the email from the beginning to create a small 3 letter string 

let smallemail = email.slice(0,3) //Output:lee //take note that 0 is the starting point since we begin to count from zero 3 is the end point which is not included

let anothersmallemail = email.substring(0,3) //Output:lee // 0 is the starting point and 3 is number of characters 

let result = email.includes('@') //result: true //It checks if @ is included. Can be used to check vulgar /links from chat rooms //Can also be used on array to check if values are available

//Make amount Number()
